# Outputs stats about performance of the CG grammar on a manually disambiguated
# (VISL format with <Correct!> marks) CORPUS. In particular:
#   * number of remaining incorrect readings ("false negatives")
#       - no ';', no '<Correct!>' mark on line
#   * number of false positives
#       - ';' at the beginning of the line, '<Correct!>' mark at the end
# In other words,
#   false negatives = readings which CG should've discarded, but did not,
#   false positives = readings which CG discarded, but really shouldn't have.
#
# Assumes that lines containing readings start with a tab, and that the main
# reading has only one leading tab, while subreadings have two or more.
#
# USAGE: ./qa.sh cg
